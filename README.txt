The application goes over all folders in the 'main folder'. It expects to find a substring of RJXXXXXX. If the folder name does not contain that format, the application asks for an RJ number. Please enter a number in the following syntax: RJ123456. You can leave the name empty to skip the folder.

It also keeps a record of all parsed works in the parsedWorks text file. If you want to re-parse a work, please remove it from the text file.
